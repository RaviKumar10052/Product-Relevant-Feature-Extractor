I bought Tamil Carvaan. Product is good. Stylish. Good Specs. The songs repeat many times. You dont know what song is going to play next. It plays randomly and takes a lot of press forward to get a new song playing. The songs are not listed in the link page as Saregama says. emailed them. yet to get reply.
It's really nice product , I'm really happy for dis , yesterday I saw some reviews for this product . And create some negativity . But today I received this radio it's really nice . Easy to use . Everything is there. Before purchase I also had same assumption but I just love it. üòç
Good collection of Tamil songs. Also has a few Hindi songs. Carnatic collection is good too. Audio quality is good too. The website has the song lists. The remote is useful and is easier to surf songs. There's no search or direct song selection though. The device itself is quite easy to use and would be liked by people of all ages. Customer service didn't give me a pleasant experience, perhaps there was no service player near my city (Hosur). There's a problem with the battery which never shows as fully charged. This was informed to Saregama who tried for doorstep service but it hasn't happened yet. Seems to be a one off case and a minor issue, as the device still plays well and long. Definitely, a good buy for music lovers. Delivery was prompt.
This product is not working as expected new out of box, i am returning the product , the sound control is not working , usb port pin is not compatible and also the remote is not working . Overall i personally feel before the product reaches the customer it should gone through rigorous Quality test. Which is missing here for sure....., Very sad . I hope this message reaches the team and they ensure this gets rectified to get better customer experience.
Great product.. slightly tacky but ok design. Most important is good collection of Tamil retro songs.
Buttons needs to improve and the dial is very sensitive. LCD is not that great. Love old songs n wish they don‚Äôt have adds in it.
Pros - They have a good collection of 5000 song. Cons
